# merge.py

<p>Merge.py is a short python script which merges several excel files/worksheets together. 
Options are hard coded for now, but we may add command line options at a later time if we feel
it is worth it.</p>

<p>This tool has several dependencies such as PANDA utility and some other general
xls reading and writing libraries. Try running the script a few times and install
the tools as errors are thrown.</p>
